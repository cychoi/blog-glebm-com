Have you ever had a change break your site? Even when the tests pass?

* Testing functionality is hard
* Testing UI is even harder

What if every time you commit, you would get a visual diff of every web page that changed?
It is surprisingly easy to do!

<%= image_tag 'gh-img-diff-1.png', class: 'img-responsive'%>

### How?
All we need is a headless browser and a testing environment.

For Rails you can use poltergeist + rspec and [just][rep-helper] do [this][rep-spec] like in my [Rails Email Preview][rep] gem. You then simply list the shots you want:

<% code 'ruby' do %>
describe 'Take screenshots', driver: :poltergeist do
  it 'home page' do
    visit '/'
    screenshot! 'home'
  end

  it 'user account page' do
    sign_in Fabricate(:user)
    visit my_account_url
    screenshot! 'my-account'
  end
end
<% end %>

The code will simply place screenshots into `spec/screenshots` after each suite run. 

Once you add `spec/screenshots` to git, things get interesting.

### Perks unlocked

* Always know when you introduce a change that changes the display
* See which commits changed screens in your app
* Instantly see what your app looked like at any point in time (since you started this)

The screenshot above shows a couple of image diffs as [Github renders them][rep-commit]. This is *visual version history* and your private *wayback in git machine*.
Github provides a number of ways to compare image, here is one of them called *swype*:
